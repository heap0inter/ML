    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data scientist / AI engineer working on an environmental impact analysis project. You have been provided with a dataset named **`\"environmental_impact_data.csv\"`**, which includes various socio-economic and environmental factors influencing the environmental impact score of different regions. The dataset comprises the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pollution_level:` The pollution level in AQI (Air Quality Index).\n",
    "- `resource_consumption:` The resource consumption in tons.\n",
    "- `population_density:` The population density in people per kmÂ².\n",
    "- `economic_activity:` The economic activity in millions.\n",
    "- `industrial_activity:` The industrial activity in index units.\n",
    "- `traffic_density:` The traffic density in vehicles per km.\n",
    "- `waste_generation:` The waste generation in kg per capita.\n",
    "- `renewable_energy_usage:` The renewable energy usage in percentage.\n",
    "- `air_quality_index:` The air quality index.\n",
    "- `carbon_footprint:` The carbon footprint in tons per year.\n",
    "- `environmental_impact_score:` The environmental impact score ranging from 0 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to analyze this dataset to understand the relationships between these factors and the environmental impact score. You will also evaluate multicollinearity among the features using correlation and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Finally, you will build machine learning models to predict the environmental impact score based on the selected features."
