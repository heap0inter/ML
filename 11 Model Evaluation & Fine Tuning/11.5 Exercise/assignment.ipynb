    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data scientist / AI engineer working on a classification problem to predict the likelihood of heart failure events based on clinical records. You have been provided with a dataset named **`\"heart_failure_clinical_records.csv\"`** which includes various clinical parameters of patients. The dataset comprises the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- age: Age of the patient (years)\n",
    "- anaemia: Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)\n",
    "- creatinine_phosphokinase: Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)\n",
    "- diabetes: If the patient has diabetes (boolean)\n",
    "- ejection_fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)\n",
    "- high_blood_pressure: If the patient has hypertension (boolean)\n",
    "- platelets: Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)\n",
    "- serum_creatinine: Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)\n",
    "- serum_sodium: Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)\n",
    "- sex: Sex of the patient (binary, 1 for male, 0 for female)\n",
    "- smoking: If the patient smokes or not (boolean)\n",
    "- time: Follow-up period (days)\n",
    "- death_event: If the patient died during the follow-up period (boolean)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use this dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict heart failure events. You will perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training using GaussianNB, SVM, and XGBoost. Additionally, you will use ROC curves to analyze model performance and make cost-benefit decisions.\n",
